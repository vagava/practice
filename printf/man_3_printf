_printf

.SH SYNOPSIS
#include "holberton.h"

**_printf** (const char *format, ...);

.SH DESCRIPTION

The  functions  in  the  _printf() produce output according to a format as described below.

.SH Flag characters
The character % is followed by zero or more of the following flags:
.IP c
If no l modifier is present, the int argument is converted to
an unsigned char, and the resulting character is written.  If
an l modifier is present, the wint_t (wide character) argument
is converted to a multibyte sequence by a call to the
wcrtomb(3) function, with a conversion state starting in the
initial state, and the resulting multibyte string is written.

.IP s 
If no l modifier is present: the const char * argument is 
expected to be a pointer to an array of character type 
(pointer to a string).  Characters from the array are written
up to (but not including) a terminating null byte ('\0'); if a
precision is specified, no more than the number specified are
written.  If a precision is given, no null byte need be
present; if the precision is not specified, or is greater than
the size of the array, the array must contain a terminating
null byte.
